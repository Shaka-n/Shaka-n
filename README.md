My name is Garen, my friends call me Stefan. I'm a software engineer, and I'm looking to make something new. I'm open to all kinds of projects, but currently I'm interested in transit tech.

Currently, I'm in the planning stage of revamping my final project for Flatiron School, a miniature travel planning app called NYCRails. I'll be making a new repo for that and updating the ReadMe, but you can check out my demo of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq5mDWkHZPg&feature=youtu.be).
  
I'm also very proud of the work I did on my algorith, visualizer, so check out the demo for that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C54HflzAUEE&feature=youtu.be) if you're interested.
