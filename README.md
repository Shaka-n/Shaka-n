My name is Garen, my friends call me Stefan. I'm a software engineer, and I'm looking to make something new. I'm open to any kind of work, but I'd prefer to have a fullstack role so that I can continue to grow my foundational skills over time. 

Currently, I'm in the planning stage of revamping my final project for Flatiron School, a miniature travel planning app called NYCRails. You can check out the demo of the original [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq5mDWkHZPg&feature=youtu.be).
  
I'm also very proud of the work I did on my algorithm visualizer, so check out the demo for that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C54HflzAUEE&feature=youtu.be) if you're interested.
